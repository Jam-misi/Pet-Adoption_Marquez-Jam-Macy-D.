Version Control: The GitHub hosted my webpage for Pet Adoption. Mainly Live GitHub Page Link

Repository Structure: GitHub hosted my webpage which consists of two html file and one css file and a folder for images. 

Summary: The Project consists of a welcome page, a section of the Webpage where the pets are shown with description for better understanding of who they’ll adopt.
A contact form page for applying for adoption of a particular pet of your choice.

Note: Pets shown are from a Philippine adoption webpage: https://www.caraphil.org/pets-for-adoption/

Reflection and Challenges: -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Reflection: Making this webpage consists of a ton of mistakes mainly to the spelling of the code or the punctuations that are needed but are forgotten.
I’ve developed the sense of perseverance, persevering my project so I can continue making it without having to abandon it. 

Challenges Faced: Like what I was saying I’ve encountered a lot of mistakes mainly of the spelling and punctuations. I’ve also had some errors regarding 
the Live Server, as I was viewing it on my browser, the live page was not found. Which I’ve solved mainly because I was not double checking,

Future Improvements:  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Additional Features: In the future I would like to implement animations and more responsiveness to my web page. I would also like to create 
a more vibrant webpage with different elements surrounding the webpage and designs to catch the attention of the customers.

Optimization: In terms of optimization, I would probably minimize the codes that are present and remove unnecessary codes to provide a more clean 
atmosphere on my Visual Studio.
